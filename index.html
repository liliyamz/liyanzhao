<span class="sans underline-d">Global Weaver</span> &mdash; Speculative app that generates cross-national symbols of identity using existing national flags as starting points for deconstruction and reconstruction. This project seeks to undermine the notion of singular nationalism in a globalized world, offering instead a flexible system that generates custom, nuanced symbols capable of capturing the rich, complex interrelationships that inform the identities of global citizens.

<span class="sans underline-d">Fringe</span> &mdash; An installation for Figment Art Festival on Governors Island consisting of a network of 5 hanging silos of various diameters, each providing shade and a semi-private space to linger in. The silo surface is woven using macrame techniques, creating a textured facade that is dense in some areas and open in others. These openings visually connect the silo interiors to the outside environment and the silos to each other. The bottom section of the silos is a ring of flowing rope fringe that participants brush through to enter the space. Within the silo interior, participants find an additional ring of hanging fringe that they can touch and interact with as they spend time in the space. The silos create an open framework that allows for and fosters unexpected social interactions. They vary in size, creating possibilities for both intimate, private moments as well as communal experiences.
